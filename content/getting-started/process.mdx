When designing for the command line, consider:

## 1. What the command does
- What makes sense to do from a terminal? What doesnâ€™t?
- What might people want to automate?
- What is the default behavior? What flags might you need to change that behavior?
- What might people try and fail to do and how can you anticipate that?
## 2. What the command is called
- What should the  [command language system](/foundations/language)  be?
- What should be a command vs a flag?
- How can you align the language of the new command with the existing commands?
## 3. What the command outputs
- What can you do to make the CLI version [feel like the GitHub.com version](/getting-started/principles#make-it-feel-like-github), using [color](/foundations/color), [language](/foundations/language), [spacing](/foundations/spacing), info shown, etc?
- How should the [machine output](/foundations/scriptability) differ from the interactive behavior?
## 4. How you explain your command
- You will need to provide a short and long description of the command for the [help pages](/components/help).
## 5. How people discover your command
- Are there ways to integrate CLI into the feature where it exists on other platforms?
